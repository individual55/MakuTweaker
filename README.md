## 🔨 Building from Source

If you want to build the program yourself:

### 🧩 Requirements
Before building, make sure you have installed:
- **.NET 8 SDK** or later
- **C# language tools**
- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)** support (included with .NET Desktop SDK)
- A compatible IDE such as **Visual Studio 2022** or **Rider**

### ☑ Build steps

1. Download or copy **only the `src` folder** from this repository.
2. Open the solution (`.sln`) file located in the `src` folder using your IDE.
3. Set the build configuration to **Release**.
4. Build the project.
5. After the build complete, open the **output folder**, located at:

src\MakuTweaker\bin\Release

Copy the `src/MakuTweaker/loc` folder into the 
`Release` Folder so that the program can find all necessary resources.
- This folder contains, JSON 
files for multi-language support.

## ❓ FAQ / Notes
Q: Why does it seem hardcoded / poorly structured?
A: The majority of source code in this respository, comes directly from the original MakuTweaker author.
This version preserves the original structure, so 
some parts may look hardcoded or not ideally organized.
It isn't a mistake of this open-source version - it reflects how the original author implemented it.
